# Vessel Density near Shipping Lanes

Vessel density is typically measured as the number of vessels within a square kilometer. But for traffic management and capacity planning near shipping lanes, better machine learning features should be used. This analysis separates the traffic into in-lane vessels, crossing vessels, and vessels within a buffer of the lanes, but neither in-lane, nor crossing.

The analysis uses _shapely_. The visualization uses _streamlit_.
